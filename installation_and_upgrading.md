# Installation & Upgrading

Docker provides an easy way to install both docker-machine and Kitematic. They've bundled everything you need to get started with Docker into [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox).

Simply download the latest release and run the installation package. This will install VirtualBox, Docker CLI, Kitematic and anything else you would need to start working with Docker images and containers

### Upgrade

To update any of the installed tools, simply download the latest version of [Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox) and run it again. This will first check if the installed packages can be updated before attempting to install anything.

When you first open Kitematic, a Virtual Machine will be created and Docker installed on it.
